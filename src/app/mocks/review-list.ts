    'comment': 'This is a very special place - beautiful setting, cosy Library Bar with cheery bar tenders - especially Sebastian, very friendly staff at breakfast - especially Sasha and Kathleen, helpful reception staff who gave great restaurant suggestions. Planning a return visit but would try to get a room with a larger, more comfortable bed next time (our only quibble).',

We (my family and I) stayed at the Ambassade hotel for a full week and were not disappointed. The accommodations were exceptional and the staff made the grade in all aspects. We would definitely stay there again.',
